          Therapists are independent contractors and are not employees, agents,
          or representatives of the Company. The Platform's function is solely
          to facilitate access to the Therapist's Services. The responsibility
          for the execution of their services rests entirely with the
          Therapists. Should the Therapist Services provided not meet your needs
          or expectations, you have the option to switch to a different
          Therapist available through the Platform. Please be aware that due to
          varying licensure requirements across different jurisdictions, not all
          Therapists listed in our database may be available for you to connect
          with, or at specific times, or for certain durations. If a Therapist
          you are working with ceases to use the Platform after you have begun
          their counselling services, we will endeavour to inform you that your
          selected Therapist is no longer available on the Platform, and you
          will have the option to choose a new Therapist.

        <p class="mb-[17px] text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">

          experience to provide their services (including specializations) in
          the jurisdiction where they and/or the User(s) are located. We may
          request proof of academic and professional qualifications from the
          Therapists. If we become aware of any false or fraudulent claims
          regarding a Therapist's license, academic credentials, experience, or

          Therapists intending to utilize the Positivty platform will be subject
          to platform fee. The Platform Fee structure and validity will be
          encapsulated in the separate Platform Fee Agreement. The platform fee
          is a prerequisite for accessing and maintaining an active presence on
          the platform. Therapists are required to sign the Platform Fee
          Agreement, which outlines the specific terms and conditions related to
          the payment and obligations of the platform fee. Execution of this
          agreement is mandatory for Therapists to activate their profiles and
          services on the Positivty platform.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-[17px] text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
          The activation and continuation of a Therapist's services on the
          Positivty platform are contingent upon the successful execution of the
          updated Platform Fee Agreement and it remains valid. Therapists who
          fail to sign this agreement annually or whichever period as determined
          by Positivty with an updated fee structure and terms of use will not
          be granted access to the platform's features and functionalities.

          These terms and conditions are subject to revision at Positivty's sole

          informed of any such changes by regularly reviewing the terms and
          conditions.
